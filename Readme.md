In continuation to **[Learning Spring framework series](http://satishab.blogspot.com/2012/10/learning-spring-framework-series-sample.html)**, created a **[Sample question & answer application](https://github.com/SatishAb/sampleqa-spring-mongo-bootstrap)** to continue exploring Spring framework and start working on Mongo DB & other tools. Application is posted to **[github](https://github.com/SatishAb/sampleqa-spring-mongo-bootstrap)** for reference. 

This is two post series **[Part 1](http://satishab.blogspot.com/2013/03/part-1-sample-q-application-using-mongo.html)** & **[Part 2](http://satishab.blogspot.com/2013/03/part-2-persistence-layer-with-mongo-db.html)**, in which I will mainly talk about using Spring Framework 3.2 & related dependencies, data modeling & operations in Mongo DB and application UI based on Bootstrap.

**[Configuring Sample question & answer application - Maven & Application Configuration](http://satishab.blogspot.com/2013/03/part-1-sample-q-application-using-mongo.html)**  
This post focuses on bootstrapping the spring application and details about maven dependencies for the Spring Framework, Mongo DB Driver, Spring Data and other dependencies. Also explains about configuration details for Spring Framework, Spring Data/Mongo.  
  
**[Modeling Sample question & answer application using MongoDB](http://satishab.blogspot.com/2013/03/part-2-persistence-layer-with-mongo-db.html)**  
This post talks about data modeling in MongoDB and details about CRUD operations using MongoTemplate.
  
**Wrapup:**  
This prototype application has given opportunity to learn, explore and experiment with different tools like Mongo DB, Bootstrap UI & Spring Framework and integrate them all to build an end-to-end scenario.
